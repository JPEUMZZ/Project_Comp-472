# Mini chess
Mini Chess is a simplified 2-player chess variant played on a 5Ã—5 board. The game is inspired by standard chess but features a reduced number of pieces and simplified rules. The objective is to capture the opponent's king.
Each player (White and Black) has 6 pieces:

### King (K): Moves 1 square in any direction. Capturing the opponent's King wins the game.

### Queen (Q): Moves any number of squares in any direction.

### Bishop (B): Moves diagonally until blocked.

### Knight (N): Moves in an L-shape (2 squares in one direction + 1 perpendicular).

### Pawns (p): Each player has 2 pawns. They move 1 square forward and capture diagonally. Pawns promote to a Queen upon reaching the last row.

# Game rules
Each turn, a player moves one piece.

Capturing occurs when a piece moves onto an opponent's piece.

Kings can move into check and be captured.

No check/checkmate rules (game ends when a King is captured).

No castling, en passant, or pawn double-moves.

The game follows a 10-move draw rule (if no piece is captured in 10 turns, it's a draw).

# Winning and Draw Conditions

### Win: 
Capturing the opponent's King.

### Draw:
10 turns without a capture. Max move limit reached (if implemented in game parameters).

### Mengqi Tong: 
- Game rules and move validation: 
- Implemented King capture logic. The game ends immediately when a King is taken.
- Added pawn promotion. Pawns reaching the last row are automatically converted to a Queen.
- Implemented a 10-turn draw rule. If no capture happens in 10 moves, the game ends in a draw.

### Thaneekan Thankarajah:
- Implemented input parameters for the game such as timeout options, maximum amount of turns, play mode, etc.
- Trace file:
- Captured every turn by players in the proper sequence of time. 
- Board initialization and capture. The resulting trace file captures the board's appearance at the moment of each turn.
- A recap of who won the game and in how many turns.
